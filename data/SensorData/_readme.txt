Notes:
- as of 2022-10-14, all csvs in dated folders are in Celsius; no csvs should be at top level folder
- export to .csv using SI (Celsius) units
- place .csvs in folder with date (YYYY-MM-DD) of collection (or approximate date)

ST Notes:
Created folder for April data run.  
Converted files to match HOBOconnect output and saved to new folder:
- changed column headings
- removed leading rows
- added leading column (did not add #s) - all data should start with column 2)
- Kept F data, but moved to column G.  
- If Dewpoint in F, moved to column H
- Created C temperature column and as needed C Dewpoint column
- Adjusted file name to match HOBOconnect naming convention

Deleted original files
Also created 3/04 folder; however, that data should all be contained in 4/09 csvs.  Did not reformat.

All Files complete 10/18
